The basic purpose of this project is to take attendance using face detection and recognition, I have created this for the Microsoft engage'22 program. This program makes CSV files of present attendees automatically After successful face detection and recognition. Also, It will make a CSV file for registered student's detailed info.

I made this program using these libraries. OpenCV, Numpy, OS, Pandas, tkinter.
